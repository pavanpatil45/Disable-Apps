## Disable Apps
Simple but useful android app to directly get into hidden setting, because in most of third party UIs like MIUI and other this setting is Hidden, or either they dont want users to disable their own built in apps.

### The manual way to access this setting in any Android -
      
      Open Playstore -> Help & feedback -> Browse all articles -> Delete or disable apps on Android -> Tap to go to Application settings.
